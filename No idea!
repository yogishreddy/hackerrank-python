Program:-
n,m=map(int,input().split())
arr = list(map(int,input().strip().split()[:n]))
A = list(map(int,input().strip().split()[:m]))
B = list(map(int,input().strip().split()[:m]))
happy =0
A = set(A)
B=set(B)
if n>=1 and n<= 10**5 and m>=1 and m<=10**5:
    for i in arr:
        if i in A:
            happy+=1
        if i in B:
            happy-=1
    print(happy)

Description:-
There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and 
dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if iEA, you add 1 to your happiness. If iEB, you add -1
to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.
Input Format
The first line contains integers  and  separated by a space.
The second line contains  integers, the elements of the array.
The third and fourth lines contain  integers,  and , respectively.

Output Format
Output a single integer, your total happiness.
