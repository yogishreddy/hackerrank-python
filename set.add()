Program:-
s=set()
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    s.add(input())
print(len(s))

Description:-
If we want to add a single element to an existing set, we can use the .add() operation.
It adds the element to the set and returns 'None'.
Example
>>> s = set('HackerRank')
>>> s.add('H')
>>> print s
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])
>>> print s.add('HackerRank')
None
>>> print s
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'HackerRank', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])
Task
